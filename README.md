Unoffical code for paper Maintaining Discrimination and Fairness in Class Incremental Learning(CVPR 2019).

This code is my reproduction of this paper.Thanks to the code base [FACIL](https://github.com/mmasana/FACIL).

I am just a green hand in incremental learning.This code is probably wrong. If you are checking my code, please forgive me for wasting your time and point out my mistakes.
